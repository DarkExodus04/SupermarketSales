<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This report is made for the purpose of Project 1 of the course EEL5934: Applied Machine learning systems. The data set used for the project is supermarket sales of various branches in cities. According to the mentioned requirements, the appropriate are regressors and classifiers are used in the project and the corresponding decisions and explanations are given.
